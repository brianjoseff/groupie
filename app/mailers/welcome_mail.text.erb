Welcome @user.name

We have decided that the time has come to tell you the truth.

Let it be known that we did not make this decision lightly, for the prophecy as spoken by Methuselah in 506 A.D., passed down from generation to generation ever since that most mystical of moments in the Oasis of Saleh, explicitly forbids us from directly speaking to you about your destiny. However, these desperate times call for similarly desperate measures, and we can no longer stand by, waiting for the stars to align, while innocent people die and humanity plunges ever closer to ruin, bringing Earth down with it.
